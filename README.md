## The Facebook Chat history visualizer

Who are these people and who were they in the past. This tool helps visualizing it.

Also, it builds you a database of your messages.

## Story
Once upon a time, I heard an idea:  

"People come and go, but you always have some to hang out with"

This statement lead me to realize how we are drifting among groups of people
in our lifeline. Who are the ones we hang out with a lot?
These visualisations help to have a look at this.


### Installation

4. save it to the same folder as where you cloned the source
5. run from command line: node .

#### Inspiration & thanks
